        This was my second graded Blender project in school, created when we had just begun learning animation.
        It features a medieval well standing in the middle of a forest, illuminated by the full moon.
        A bucket hangs from the well, gently swinging from side to side, while a lantern is flickering,
        evoking a mysterious and slightly eerie atmosphere.

        This was the first group project I worked on with my friends/classmates. We had one month to complete it and were assigned random themes, 
        including Edinburgh Castle, a snow-covered landscape, and the Jump 'n' Run genre.
        In Journey of the Icebound, an evil Ice Dragon has imprisoned a princess in the castle's basement and flooded the entire fortress with toxic
        ice water, causing furniture to float chaotically throughout the rooms. 
        The player's objective is to navigate platforming challenges across the castle, using the drifting furniture to progress, 
        reach the dragon's island, defeat it, and rescue the princess.
